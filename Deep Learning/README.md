# In this folder you can find relevant notebooks demonstarting the use of deep learning techniques in RecSys

1) DeepFM - This is an example of how we can apply DeepFM using 'deepctr' to solve a binary classification problem.
2) NeuMF - This notebook demonstrate the use of NeuMF. As a code task you will need to implement a new version of NeuMF which perform average weight between GMF and MLP component and add the use of validation set, and the following callbacks: model checkpoint and early stoppoing.
